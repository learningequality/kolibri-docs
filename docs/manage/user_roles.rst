.. tip::
   If you are unable to retrieve the username and password for a super admin account in your facility, you can :ref:`create a new super admin account using the command line <create_superuser>`.

Assign Additional Permissions
-----------------------------

By default, only **super admin** users can view the **Device** dashboard, import/export channels in Kolibri, and modify **Permissions** for other users. However, depending on the needs of the institution, **super admin** users can also :ref:`grant these permissions <permissions>` to other users.
