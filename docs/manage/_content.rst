Manage Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
  To manage Kolibri content channels you must have the appropriate permissions.

Kolibri **Content Channel** is a collection of educational resources (video, audio, document files or interactive apps) prepared and organized by the content curator for their use in Kolibri. You can import and export content channels in Kolibri from the **Channels** tab of the **Device** dashboard (|channels| icon).

  .. figure:: img/manage-content.png
    :alt: Open the Device page and Channels tab to see the list of available channels on your device

    Kolibri content channels in the Device > Channels tab.


.. _id_token:

Each Kolibri content channel has its own **token/ID** in `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__. You can freely view and browse content to import from the **public** channels in Kolibri, but in order to :ref:`import content from private or unlisted channels <import_with_token>`, you will need the **channel token or ID from the content curator who assembled it**.

.. note:: The term **Channel ID** was valid for Kolibri versions up to 0.6, while from the Kolibri version 0.7 onward, we started using exclusively the term **token** to uniquely designate each channel.

.. warning:: When you :ref:`use the Terminal or command prompt <import_command_line>` to import content channels in Kolibri from the command line, you still must use the **32 digit channel ID**, as the command will not work with the token. Make sure to receive the correct channel ID from the person who curated the channel you need to import, or refer to `Kolibri Studio user guide <https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/share_channels.html#make-content-channels-available-for-import-into-kolibri>`__ how to find it in Studio user interface, if you have channel editor access.



Import Content into Kolibri
---------------------------

.. warning:: **Important**: You **cannot** import your own files (videos, documents, etc.) as learning resources directly into Kolibri from your computer. Kolibri can **only** import content from:

  * already curated **content channels** on `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__, if the computer running Kolibri is connected to internet

  OR 

  * an external storage drive (USB or hard drive) where content channels have been previously exported to from another Kolibri installation, if the computer running Kolibri is not connected to internet

  **To import your own files for use in Kolibri**, you need to register at `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__ site (it's free), and build your own content channel that you can subsequently import into Kolibri. Read more about how to do this in our `Kolibri Studio user guide <https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__.


.. warning::
  Kolibri database and content may become temporarily unavailable while importing or updating large content channels. Therefore, as a precaution, we recommend you:

  * avoid other interactions with Kolibri (view learner pages or manage users, for example) while content import is in progress
  * perform these maintenance operations outside the periods when system is being used by learners


To import content into Kolibri, follow these steps.

#. Click :guilabel:`IMPORT` in the **Channels** tab on the **Device** page.
#. Choose the source option: **Kolibri Studio**, **Local network or internet**, or **Attached drive or memory card**.

11. To add more learning resources from a channel that you previously imported content from, click :guilabel:`OPTIONS`, select **Import more**, and repeat the selection procedure from step 3. 


.. _local_network:

Import Content from a Local Network or Internet
***********************************************

You can also import content from a different device running Kolibri in your same local network, or even from a Kolibri server hosted outside your LAN, provided you know its exact IP address. This feature is useful for when you have:

* a larger country- or region level Kolibri content server outside your LAN, but with resources specific to your implementation requirements
* various instances of Kolibri servers in your local network, in order to support a high number of client (learner) devices 
  
Follow these steps to import content channels.

#. Choose option *Local network or internet*, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Click *New address* link to add a new network address.
#. Input the full network address, and assign a name for this network. Don't forget to add the correct port if different from the default one ``8080``. You can use either the IP address or the domain name.
  
  .. figure:: img/new-network-address.png
    :alt: Use the text input fields to add the new address and the name for the local network import

#. Click :guilabel:`ADD` to save this address to your device settings. If you later decide to delete it, use the link *Forget*.
#. Click :guilabel:`CONTINUE` and follow the same steps for selecting topics and resources as for the :ref:`import from Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`.

.. warning:: This feature was introduced in Kolibri version 0.11, and all the server devices to be used for this type of content import **must have the Kolibri version 0.11 or later** running.

.. _local_drive:


Import Content from a Local Drive
*********************************

If the computer where Kolibri server is running does not have access to Internet or has insufficient bandwidth, you have the option to receive content channels stored on an external drive (USB stick or hard disk). Follow these steps to import content channels.

#. Connect the external USB drive to your computer.
#. Choose option for *Attached drive or memory card*, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Kolibri will automatically detect and display the drive(s) with available Kolibri content files.
#. Select the drive where the desired channel is stored, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Click :guilabel:`SELECT` for the desired channel, and follow the same steps for selecting topics and resources as for the :ref:`import from Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`.

  .. figure:: img/import-local-drive2.png
    :alt: Importing content from a local drive presents the same interface options as importing from Kolibri Studio.


Workaround for import from external drive on older devices
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If Kolibri is installed on an older or a low-resource device, you can try the following procedure for importing content channels for faster results.

#. Stop Kolibri.
#. Browse the local drive with the file explorer of your operating system.
#. Copy the ``content`` folder located inside the ``KOLIBRI_DATA`` folder on the local drive.
#. Paste the copied ``content`` folder inside the ``.kolibri`` folder on your hard disk. The location of the ``.kolibri`` folder will depend on your operating system (see the table below).
#. Confirm the merge of the two folders.
#. Restart Kolibri, and the new channels should now be available.
  
**Beware that the restart might take longer after these steps, as Kolibri needs to map all the new content in the database.**  


.. _home:

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| **Operating system**      | **Location**                            |
+===========================+=========================================+
| Windows                   | ``C:/Users/<your_username>/.kolibri/``  |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| OSX                       | ``HD/Users/<your_username>/.kolibri/``  |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Linux                     | ``/home/<your_username>/.kolibri/``     |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

On Linux and OSX you will need to enable the **Show hidden folders** option in order to view the ``.kolibri`` folder.    


Update Content Channels
-----------------------

Public channels on Kolibri Studio are periodically updated from their original sources. Private and unlisted channels that you have on your local Kolibri device may also have changed since you first imported them. You can update your local channels from Kolibri Studio from online sources, from another updated device in your local network or from an external drive where the latest version of the channels has been :ref:`previously exported <export>`.

.. warning:: Don't update channels used to make :ref:`lessons <manage_lessons>` and :ref:`quizzes <manage_quizzes>` while those are **still active and visible to learners**. The structure and location of some resources inside the channel may have changed in the updated version, which can render them unavailable and create loading issues. It is recommended to **schedule and perform channel updates only during periods when learners are not actively working on lessons and quizzes**.

To update a channel to its latest version and import new content into Kolibri, follow these steps.

#. Click :guilabel:`OPTIONS` for the channel you want to update, and select **Import more**.
#. Choose the source option: **Kolibri Studio**, **Local network or internet** or **Attached drive or memory card**.
#. If there is a new channel version available, you will see the notification.

    .. figure:: img/update-channel.png
      :alt: 

      Notification for the new version of the content channel.

4. Click the :guilabel:`UPDATE` button and wait for the updated topic tree to load.
5. You will see empty check boxes for any new content added to the channel since your last import. Select and import content by following the steps from :ref:`Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`, :ref:`local network <local_network>`, or :ref:`attached drive <local_drive>`.


.. _export:

Export from Kolibri to Local Drive
----------------------------------

If you have imported content on one Kolibri device, and want to make it available on another computer where Kolibri is installed, follow these steps to export your content channels.

.. note::
  You must have an external drive (SD card, USB stick or hard disk) attached to your device.

#. Click :guilabel:`EXPORT` in the **Channels** tab on the **Device** page.
#. Select the local drive (destination for the export) where you wish to export Kolibri content, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. In the *Export to <name-of-your-drive>* page you will be able to see all the available content channels on your device.

    .. figure:: img/export-to.png
  	  :alt: Select from which channel you want to export to local drive.

#. Click :guilabel:`SELECT` for the desired channel, and wait for Kolibri to display the channel information and the topic tree.
#. In the **Select content from...** page you will see all the details of the selected channel: description, version, total size and number of learning resources.
#. Under **Choose content to export** you can browse the channel topics and individual resources. Use the *Select all* checkbox to import the content channel in full, or select only certain topics or resources. As you keep selecting, you will see the total number and size on disk under *Resources selected:*, and the remaining space on the destination drive.
#. Click :guilabel:`EXPORT` once you finish selecting all the desired content.
#. Wait for Kolibri to export the selected content and click :guilabel:`CLOSE`.
#. Once the export is finished, safely disconnect the drive according to the recommended procedure for your operating system, and proceed to import channels on other devices.

    .. note:: This procedure makes a copy of the ``content`` folder located inside the ``.kolibri`` folder on your hard disk, and places it in the ``KOLIBRI_DATA`` folder on the selected local drive. This structure is recognized by the **Import from local drive** command.

        .. figure:: img/kolibri-data-osx.png

Delete Channel
--------------

To delete a content channel from your device, follow these steps.

#. Click :guilabel:`OPTIONS` for the channel you want to delete.
#. Select **Delete** option.

    .. figure:: img/delete-channel.png
      :alt: 
    
#. Click :guilabel:`DELETE` to proceed, or :guilabel:`CANCEL` to exit without deleting the channel.
