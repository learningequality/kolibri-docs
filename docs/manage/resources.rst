Channels and Resources
######################

.. note::
  To manage Kolibri channels and resources you must have the appropriate permissions.

Kolibri **Channel** is a collection of educational resources (video, audio, document files or interactive apps) prepared and organized by the channel curator for their use in Kolibri. You can import and export channels in Kolibri from the **Channels** tab of the **Device** dashboard (|channels| icon).

  .. figure:: /img/manage-resources.png
    :alt: Open the Device page and Channels tab to see the list of available channels on your device

    Kolibri channels in the Device > Channels tab.


.. _id_token:

Each Kolibri channel has its own **token** in `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__. You can freely view and browse resources to import from the **public** channels in Kolibri, but in order to :ref:`import resources from private or unlisted channels <import_with_token>`, you will need the **channel token from the resources curator who assembled it**.

.. note:: The term **Channel ID** was valid for Kolibri versions up to 0.6, while from the Kolibri version 0.7 onward, we started using exclusively the term **token** to uniquely designate each channel.

.. warning:: When you :ref:`use the Terminal or command prompt <import_command_line>` to import channels in Kolibri from the command line, you still must use the **32 digit channel ID**, as the command will not work with the token. Make sure to receive the correct channel ID from the person who curated the channel you need to import, or refer to `Kolibri Studio user guide <https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/share_channels.html>`__ how to find it in Studio user interface, if you have channel editor access.

Kolibri Task Manager
--------------------

You can start various resource management tasks (import, export, deletion, update, etc.) in Kolibri and observe their progress in the *task manager* page. Each time you start a task, Kolibri will display the **Tasks** page, and depending on your workflow, you may have some *Finished*, *In-progress*, *Canceled* or tasks *Waiting* in the queue.

  .. figure:: /img/task-queue.png
    :alt: 

    Kolibri task manager. 

*  Use the :guilabel:`CLEAR` button to clear single tasks.
*  Use :guilabel:`CLEAR COMPLETED` to delete all the tasks from the list.
*  Click the **Back to channels** link to navigate away from the **Tasks** page to the **Device > Channels** tab.
*  On top of the **Device > Channels** page you will see a summary of the current tasks. Click the **View task manager** link to return to the **Tasks** page with the detailed information.

Import Channels and Resources into Kolibri
------------------------------------------

.. warning:: **Important**: You **cannot** import your own files (videos, documents, etc.) as learning resources directly into Kolibri from your computer. Kolibri can **only** import resources from:

  * already curated **channels** on `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__, if the computer running Kolibri is connected to internet
  
  * :ref:`another device in the same local network <local_network>` through *peer import*

  OR 

  * an external storage drive (USB or hard drive) where channels have been previously exported to from another Kolibri installation, if the computer running Kolibri is not connected to internet

  **To import your own files for use in Kolibri**, you need to register at `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/accounts/login/>`__ site (it's free), and build your own channel that you can subsequently import into Kolibri. Read more about how to do this in our `Kolibri Studio user guide <https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__.


To import resources into Kolibri, follow these steps.

#. Click :guilabel:`IMPORT` in the **Channels** tab on the **Device** page.
#. Choose the source option: **Kolibri Studio**, **Local network or internet**, or **Attached drive or memory card**.

  .. figure:: /img/import-choose-source.png

2. Click :guilabel:`SELECT RESOURCES` for the desired channel, and wait for Kolibri to load the channel information and the topic tree.

   .. warning:: This could take some time for big channels. Please be patient, as Kolibri needs to retrieve a lot of information to display.


#. In the following page you will see all the details for the selected channel: description, version, total size and number of learning resources, with the information weather you have some of the resources from that channel already imported on the local device.

    .. figure:: /img/select-content.png
	    :alt: 

#. Click the topics links to browse through the channel resources. Use the *Select all* checkbox to import all the resources in the channel, or select only certain topics or resources. As you keep selecting, you will see the total number and size of *resources selected* at the bottom of the page.

#. Click the :guilabel:`IMPORT` button once you finish selecting all the desired resources.

#. You will see the import progress in the **Task manager** page. Once the import concludes, the newly imported channel and resources display on the **Channels** page.

    .. figure:: /img/import-CC.png
  	  :alt: resources import progress bar will display the percentage of the download


Import Entire Channels
""""""""""""""""""""""

To import entire channels instead of a selected resources, follow these steps.

#. Click the **Select entire channels instead** link above the list of public channels in Kolibri.
#. Use the checkboxes to select the channels you want to import in full. As you keep selecting, you will see the total number and size of *channels selected* at the bottom of the page.
#. Click the :guilabel:`IMPORT` button once you finish selecting all the desired channels.

.. warning:: You can also use the *Select all on page* option, but beware that it will require several hundreds of gigabytes on your hard drive, and likely prolonged import times.

.. _import_with_token:

Import with Token
"""""""""""""""""

#. If you need to import resources from a **private/unlisted** channel, click on **Import with token** button above the channel list.  
#. Enter the **channel token** received from the channel curator on Kolibri Studio.

    .. figure:: /img/enter-token.png
  	  :alt: Use the text input field to enter channel token in order to import from an unlisted channel

#. Click :guilabel:`CONTINUE` to unlock the channel, or :guilabel:`CANCEL` to exit.
#. Proceed to select and import channel topics and resources as for the public channels.

   Unlisted or private channels in the list are indicated with the |unlisted-channel| icon.

   .. warning:: Unlisted channel **must be published** on Studio before the token can be used to import it.

Import More Resources
"""""""""""""""""""""

To add more learning resources from a channel that you previously imported resources from, follow these steps.

#. Click the :guilabel:`MANAGE` button for the desired channel.
#. Click :guilabel:`IMPORT MORE`.
#. Repeat the selection procedure from above. 


.. _local_network:

Import from a Local Network or Internet
***************************************

You can also import resources from a different device running Kolibri in your same local network, or even from a Kolibri server hosted outside your LAN, provided you know its exact IP address. This feature is useful for when you have:

* a larger country- or region-level Kolibri server outside your LAN, but with resources specific to your implementation requirements
* various instances of Kolibri servers in your local network, in order to support a high number of client (learner) devices 
  
.. note:: Kolibri will try to automatically detect other instances (*peers*) running in the same LAN, and you will see a spinning loader while it is searching. When the detection is successful, you will be able to select these Kolibri instances and import resources from them.

    .. figure:: /img/peer.png
      :alt: 


Follow these steps to import from a local network.

#. Choose option *Local network or internet*, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Click *Add new address* link to add a new network address.
#. Input the full network address, and assign a name for this network. Don't forget to add the correct port if different from the default one ``8080``. You can use either the IP address or the domain name.
  
  .. figure:: /img/new-network-address.png
    :alt: Use the text input fields to add the new address and the name for the local network import


#. Click :guilabel:`ADD` to save this address to your device settings. If you later decide to delete it, use the link *Forget*.
#. Click :guilabel:`CONTINUE` and follow the same steps for selecting topics and resources as for the :ref:`import from Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`.

.. warning:: 
  
  * Beware that active firewalls on your devices could cause:

    - inability to be discovered by peers
    - inability to discover other peers
    - ability to be discovered, but not be available for import
  
  * On Windows 10 you need to explicitly allow both **Python** and ``kolibri.exe`` processes through the firewall, to be able to add a peer for import. Auto-discovery might still not work, but you will be able to add the peer IP manually and import resources.

  * This feature was introduced in Kolibri version 0.11, and all the server devices to be used for this type of resources import **must have the Kolibri version 0.11 or later** running.


.. tip:: If want to :ref:`allow peer import of your private channels <allow_peer_import>`, which means that those channels will be visible and available for import on other peer devices in the same network, make sure to enable that option in the **Device > Settings**. 


.. _local_drive:


Import from a Local Drive
*************************

If the computer where Kolibri server is running does not have access to Internet or has insufficient bandwidth, you have the option to receive resources channels stored on an external drive (USB stick or hard disk). Follow these steps to import resources channels.

#. Connect the external USB drive to your computer.
#. Choose option for *Attached drive or memory card*, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Kolibri will automatically detect and display the drive(s) with available Kolibri resources files.
#. Select the drive where the desired channel is stored, and click :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Click :guilabel:`SELECT` for the desired channel, and follow the same steps for selecting topics and resources as for the :ref:`import from Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`.

  .. figure:: /img/import-local-drive2.png
    :alt: Importing resources from a local drive presents the same interface options as importing from Kolibri Studio.


Update Channels
---------------

Public channels on Kolibri Studio are periodically updated from their original sources. Private and unlisted channels that you have on your local Kolibri device may also have changed since you first imported them. You can update your local channels from Kolibri Studio from online sources, from another updated device in your local network or from an external drive where the latest version of the channels have been :ref:`previously exported <export>`.

.. warning:: It is recommended to schedule and perform channel updates only during periods of low activity on the server. Updating resources while server is receiving requests by client devices may cause errors or performance issues.

To update a channel to its latest version and import new resources into Kolibri, follow these steps.

#. Click the :guilabel:`MANAGE` button for the channel you want to update.
#. When a new channel version is available, you will see the notification. Click the *View changes* link.
   
    .. figure:: /img/view-changes.png
      :alt: 

#. On the following page you can see the summary of the changes: how many resources will be added, deleted or updated if you decide to proceed. 

    .. figure:: /img/update-channel.png
      :alt: 

      Notification for the new version of the resources channel.


#. Click the :guilabel:`UPDATE CHANNEL` button, and then :guilabel:`CONTINUE` to confirm.

      :alt: 

      Confirm that you want to update channel to the new version.

    .. warning:: Use caution when updating channels that have been used to make **currently-active** :ref:`lessons <manage_lessons>` and :ref:`quizzes <manage_quizzes>`. The structure and location of some resources inside the channel may have changed in the updated version, which can cause lessons and quizzes to not load correctly. 

#. After the channel has been updated to the newest version, you will see the page with the list of all the topics that contain new resources. Proceed to select what you want to import, or check **Select all** to import everything at once.

    Review the number and disk size of selected resources at the bottom and click the :guilabel:`IMPORT` button.

    .. figure:: /img/select-updated-resources.png
      :alt: 

      Select the resources you want to update.

#. You will see the update progress in the **Tasks** page. Once the update concludes, the newly imported and updated resources will be available to use in Kolibri.


.. warning:: 
  All import tasks can be cancelled before they are labeled as *Completed* in the **Task manager** page. However, beware that resources from canceled imports might not be fully available. If you plan to use the resources in lessons or quizzes, please check the state of their channel before you do, and use the :guilabel:`IMPORT MORE` button if necessary.
