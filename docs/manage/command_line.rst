Working with Kolibri from the Command Line
##########################################

* In Windows you need to open the command prompt, for example by using the :guilabel:`WIN` + :guilabel:`R` shortcut, and then typing ``cmd``.

      .. figure:: /img/cmd.exe.png
        :alt: 

* On macOS open Spotlight and type ``Terminal``. You may also need to prefix the commands with ``python -m``, for example ``python -m kolibri start``.

* If you are running Kolibri with the ``.pex`` file, make sure to substitute the ``kolibri`` in below commands **with the exact name of the file you downloaded** preceded by ``./``. For example, to start Kolibri from the downloaded file ``kolibri-v0.14.pex``, type ``./kolibri-v0.14.pex start``.

.. warning:: In the commands below, angle brackets and the text between them ``<...>`` are used to denote placeholders for you to modify. Make sure to replace them with your own information.


If you see errors in the prompt/terminal output while running the commands below, ask for help at our `Community Forums <https://community.learningequality.org/>`_, or `file an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/issues/new>`_.


Start/Stop Kolibri
******************

In case you need to troubleshoot potential problems while running Kolibri, you may try to start it manually from the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri start --debug --foreground


.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri stop


.. _import_command_line:


Import Channels from Internet
*****************************

To import channels from Internet, run these two commands in sequence. The first downloads the channel database, and the second downloads the resources (videos, documents, etc.). 

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage importchannel network <Channel ID>
  kolibri manage importcontent network <Channel ID>


For example (``Channel ID`` without angle brackets ``<...>``): 

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage importchannel network a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337
  kolibri manage importcontent network a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337

.. warning:: When you import channels from the command line, you still must use the **32 digit channel ID**, as the :ref:`command will not work with the token <id_token>`. Make sure to receive the correct channel ID from the person who curated the unlisted channel you need to import, or refer to `Kolibri Studio user guide <https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/share_channels.html#make-content-channels-available-for-import-into-kolibri>`_ how to find it in Studio user interface, if you have channel editor access.

..
  Commented out because the API is weird and should be fixed
  
  Import Content Channels from a Local Drive
  ------------------------------------------
  
  To import content channels from the local drive, run these two commands in sequence. Local drive should have a folder ``KOLIBRI_DATA`` at the root, with Kolibri ``content`` inside.
  
  .. code-block:: bash
  
    kolibri manage importchannel -- local <Channel ID> /path/to/local/drive
    kolibri manage importcontent -- local <Channel ID> /path/to/local/drive


Export Channels
***************

To export Kolibri channels on a local drive in order to share it with another device, run these two commands in sequence. The first exports the channel database, and the second exports the resources (videos, documents, etc.). 

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage exportchannel <Channel ID> /path/to/local/drive/KOLIBRI_DATA 
  kolibri manage exportcontent <Channel ID> /path/to/local/drive/KOLIBRI_DATA 

The path should be to a folder named ``KOLIBRI_DATA`` at the root of the local drive, so it will get picked up later for importing via the Web UI.

.. _reorder_channels:

Reorder Channels
****************

You can set the specific order for channels in the **Learn** page according to your preferences. Follow these steps.

* To view the current ordered list of channels, run the command: 
   
  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage listchannels


  The output will be something like:

  .. code-block:: bash

    Pos       ID                                      Name
    ---       --                                      ----
    1         95a52b386f2c485cb97dd60901674a98        CK-12 Testing
    2         a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337        TESSA - Teacher Resources


* To set a position for a channel, run the command: 
   
  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage setchannelposition <Channel ID> <Pos>


  Example with the above channels:

  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage setchannelposition a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579 1

    Pos       ID                                      Name
    ---       --                                      ----
    1         a9b25ac9814742c883ce1b0579448337        TESSA - Teacher Resources
    2         95a52b386f2c485cb97dd60901674a98        CK-12 Testing


.. _create_superuser:

Create a New Super Admin
************************

In case you need to create another **super admin** user, either to address additional need of managing facility, or if you lost the password for the old one, run the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage createsuperuser

You will be prompted to input the **Username** and **Password** and the new **super admin** user account will be created. 

The full name for the new super admin user will be the same as the chosen ``username``, and can be edited in the **Facility > Users** page, or the user profile.


Import and Export User Data from a CSV File
*******************************************

This feature is also available from the Kolibri user interface in the **Facility > Data** tab. It is recommended you read the :ref:`section of this guide which documents the feature <csv_import>`, especially the part about the :ref:`CSV format <csv_format>` before you try this command line utility. 

Import from CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Execute the *dry-run* of the command to review the report containing the number of users and classes to be created, updated or deleted, and see the list of any potential errors.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage bulkimportusers --dryrun --output-file=my-school-users-2020.csv


Run the command and review that the changes are visible in the **Facility** dashboard.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage bulkimportusers --output-file=my-school-users-2020.csv


If the CSV file does not contain all the non admin users or classes currently in the facility, using the ``--delete`` flag will remove them during the import process.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage bulkimportusers --delete --output-file=my-school-users-2020.csv


Export to CSV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following command to create a ``users_<date>_<time>.csv`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage bulkexportusers --overwrite --output-file=my-school-users-2020.csv


To export a CSV file with localized headers, use the ``--locale`` flag.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage bulkexportusers --overwrite --output-file=lista-estudiantes-2020.csv --locale=es_ES



Change User's Password
**********************

Run the following command to change the password for a user. 

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage changepassword <username>

You will be prompted twice to input the new password for the user.


Delete Users Permanently
************************

If you need to permanently delete a Kolibri user and all the data associated with their account, for example to ensure privacy rights according to GDPR, use the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage deleteuser <username>


.. warning:: This will permanently erase all the user data.

.. _export_data_logs:

Export Data Logs
****************

If the data logs export process from **Facility > Data** is taking a long time, use the following command to export logs from the terminal or command prompt. 

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage exportlogs --log-type summary
  kolibri manage exportlogs --log-type session


Backup and Restore Kolibri Database
***********************************

Kolibri automatically creates a backup of the database with every version upgrade. If for some reason you need to make a manual backup, use the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage dbbackup

This command will create a time-stamped ``.dump`` file in the ``./kolibri/backups`` folder that you can use to restore the database with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage dbrestore --latest

To restore the DB from a specific ``.dump`` file, use the flag ``--select`` to see all that available sorted by date, and select the one you need.

.. code-block:: bash

  kolibri manage dbrestore --select

.. warning::
  This command is not intended for replication across different devices, but **only** for restoring on a single device from a local backup of the database.


Change the Location of Kolibri Channels Files
*********************************************

Kolibri channels may occupy a considerable amount of hard disk space over time. If you have concerns about running out of storage on your device, you can move the Kolibri **channels** to another drive.

.. tip::
  If you have both SSD disk and HDD disk available on your device, it is recommended to install Kolibri on the SSD drive to allow faster access to the database, and move just the channels to the HDD drive.

To move the folders with Kolibri channels to another location, follow these steps.

1. Stop Kolibri.

  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri stop


2. Create a new folder that will contain all the channels' files and resources on the destination drive.

  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage content movedirectory <destination>


  For example, if you created a new folder ``KolibriChannels`` on an external drive, run this command.

  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage content movedirectory /mnt/my_external_drive/KolibriChannels


  If you are on Windows, and the new folder ``KolibriChannels`` is on the drive ``F:``, run this command.

  .. code-block:: bash

    kolibri manage content movedirectory F:\KolibriChannels


3. Restart Kolibri.

This command will move the 2 subfolders ``databases`` and ``storage``, from their default location inside the ``.kolibri/content`` folder in your device's home directory, to a new location you specified in the command.


Change the Location of ALL Kolibri Files
****************************************

If you want to change the directory where all of Kolibri's runtime files are located, together with the imported channels, you need to change the environment variable called ``KOLIBRI_HOME`` to the path of your choice.

If the variable is left unset, by default, Kolibri's runtime files and channels will be placed in your user’s home folder, under the ``.kolibri`` subfolder. 

.. note::
  Adjusting this environment variable behaves differently than the ``movedirectory`` command above:

  * Adjusting the environment variable will not automatically migrate over data. You need to copy the ``.kolibri`` folder manually to the new location.
  * If you do copy the ``.kolibri`` folder, the channels will not be affected **if it had been previously set** using the ``movedirectory`` command.


There are many ways to set an environment variable either temporarily or permanently. To start Kolibri on **OSX or Linux** with a different home, follow these steps.

#. Stop the server.
#. Move the ``.kolibri`` folder to the new location.
#. Run the following in Terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  KOLIBRI_HOME=/path/to/new/home kolibri start

When you start the server again, all your files should be seamlessly detected at that location.

To change the environment variable ``KOLIBRI_HOME`` on **Windows**, follow these steps.

#. Stop the server.
#. Move the ``.kolibri`` folder to the new location.
#. Run the following in Command Prompt:

  .. code-block:: bash

    setx KOLIBRI_HOME "/path/to/new/home"

Restart the server, and your files should be seamlessly detected at the new location.


Alternatively, you can follow these steps in the GUI.

#. Go to **Computer > Advanced System Settings** and press the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` button.
#. Under **User Variables for...** press the :guilabel:`New...` button.
#. Input ``KOLIBRI_HOME`` in the **Variable name** field, and your new path in the **Variable value** field, and press :guilabel:`OK` on both open windows.

    .. figure:: /img/env-vars.png
      :alt: 

#. Restart Kolibri.
