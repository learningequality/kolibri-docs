Import and Export Users from a CSV file
***************************************

To import and export many users and classes at once you can use an externally generated CSV (comma separated values) file. 

  .. figure:: /img/csv-import-export.png
    :alt: 

    Import and export users with CSV.

.. warning:: Importing from CSV will make many changes to your users and classes, and these changes cannot be easily reverted. Read carefully the requirements below, and make sure to verify that the data in your CSV file is accurate and adheres to the format reference. 

For the import to be successful, you must have a CSV file with properly formatted data with some required values. We recommend the following procedure:

#. Use the **Export** :ref:`feature first and save the CSV file <csv_export>` which contains all users and classes you already have in the facility.
#. Open the CSV file with an external spreadsheet program and make changes.
#. Export *a new CSV file* from the spreadsheet program.
#. Use that CSV file to **Import** or update users and classes.

.. tip:: You can also use this :download:`CSV file template </data/users_example.csv>` to get familiar with the required format. 

.. _csv_format:

Import Users

Importing users from a CSV file will make the following changes to your facility:

* Create new user accounts (for any ``USERNAME`` in the CSV that does not exist in the facility).
* Update existing user accounts (when the username in the database and the CSV match exactly).
* Set which classes each learner is enrolled in.
* Set which classes each coach is assigned to.
* Create new classes (for any value of ``ENROLLED_IN`` or ``ASSIGNED_TO`` in the CSV that does not match exactly the existing class name in the facility).
* Delete any users and classes in the facility if not referenced in the CSV.
