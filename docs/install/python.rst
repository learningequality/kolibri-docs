Python package
--------------

You can install Kolibri as a standard package from PyPi (works on Mac, Windows, and Linux) using this command:

#. Install for your current user.

	.. code-block:: bash
	  
	  pip install --user kolibri

#. Install system-wide (for all users).

	.. code-block:: bash
	  
	  sudo pip install kolibri

After Kolibri has been installed from PyPi, a new ``kolibri`` command should be available in your Terminal application.


.. _pex:

Python EXecutable
-----------------

On MacOS and Linux, follow these steps to run Kolibri with the ``PEX`` package. 

#. Download the `PEX installer <https://learningequality.org/download/>`_ for Kolibri **version 0.14**. 
#. Make sure to **open the Terminal where you downloaded** the ``PEX`` file. For example, if you saved it in the *Downloads* folder, type this when you open the Terminal, and press Enter:

	.. code-block:: bash

	  cd Downloads

#. Type the following commands next (press Enter after each one). 


	.. code-block:: bash

	  chmod +x kolibri-installer-filename.pex
	  ./kolibri-installer-filename.pex start

	.. note:: Make sure to **substitute the** ``kolibri-installer-filename.pex`` **with the exact name of the file you downloaded** in both commands. For example, if the name of the downloaded file is ``kolibri-v0.14.0.pex``, type that instead of ``kolibri-installer-filename.pex``. 

#. When the command finishes, open the default browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and proceed with the :ref:`setup_initial` of your facility. 
   
.. warning:: Remember that **PEX** package allows you to run Kolibri on your system **only while the process is active in the Terminal window**. If that process is stopped (by either pressing :guilabel:`Ctrl` + :guilabel:`C`, closing the Terminal, or restarting your system), you will need to repeat the above steps to start Kolibri again. User accounts, classes and groups you create, as well as the channels you download, will be available every time you restart Kolibri. 


Uninstall PEX
-------------

#. Delete the ``PEX`` file.
#. Delete the ``~/.kolibri`` folder in your user's Home directory if you want to completely remove all the Kolibri files and channels you imported.

Upgrade PEX
-----------

To upgrade Kolibri, follow these steps.

#. Download the new version of `Kolibri PEX installer <https://learningequality.org/download/>`_.
#. Start Kolibri as during the first install.
