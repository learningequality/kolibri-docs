Kolibri Android App runs as a standalone app on phone and tablet mobile devices. It has similar features and functionalities as Kolibri installed on desktop and laptop devices, but you must keep in mind its limitations, especially regarding the storage capacity and the amount of channels and resources you will be able to import in your Android device.

You will need Internet access or a data plan on your mobile device to download Kolibri Android App and import learning resources, but no Internet or data is required thereafter to use the Kolibri Android App.

Compatibility
-------------

Android version 5.0 and higher.


Storage requirements
--------------------

App: 60MB

Storage occupied by Kolibri channels will depend on the amount and type of resources you decide to import. Video resources will in general occupy much more storage space and take longer to import compared to exercises and resources in HTML format. Check the **Settings > Storage** on your device to see how much internal space you have available to import on your device. 


Install

#. Download Kolibri Android App from Google Play Store.
#. Follow the installation steps on your Android device.

Storage
*******

When selecting resources to import to your Android device keep in mind 2 things:
* Available storage space. Do frequent checks in Settings > Storage on your device to see how much internal space is available to import.
* Data consumption. If you need to restrict the usage of your mobile data plan, find an Internet access point or a WiFi network that you can use while importing channels.

Limited support for background activity
***************************************

You cannot rely on Kolibri to stay "awake" if you do not see it on the screen.The safest way to make sure that long running tasks complete is to ensure that the application stays open and the screen stays on during use. For example, you may have to disable **sleep** settings when downloading large channels, and keep the device connected to power outlet.

Access to SD card
*****************

 Not available:

* Downloading single resources
* CSV import/export (users and data)
