=======

Kolibri Android App runs as a standalone (it does not require a browser) on phone and tablet mobile devices. Keep the following in mind:

* When installed and set up in :term:`On my own` modality, Kolibri will have the same coach and admin features as Kolibri installed on desktop and laptop devices.
* When installed and set up as :term:`Learn-only device`, Kolibri will only have the features for learners.

Compatibility
-------------

Android version 8.0 and higher.


Storage requirements
--------------------

App only: approximately 200MB

Content: 

* Kolibri app will most probably occupy more storage when set up in the :term:`On my own` modality that allows :ref:`direct import of channels and resources from Kolibri Studio <import_studio>`. Video resources will in general occupy much more storage space and take longer to import compared to exercises and resources in HTML format. 
* Kolibri app on a :term:`Learn-only device` cannot import resources from Studio, but learners can browse and download single resources from libraries on other Kolibris in the local network. 

Check the **Settings > Storage** on your Android device to see how much internal space you have available for download globally, and configure the :ref:`maximum storage space you want to set aside for Kolibri resources <storage>`.
