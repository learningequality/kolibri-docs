Initial Setup
=============

To do the initial setup of your Kolibri facility after the installation, follow these steps.

.. note::
  You need to do the initial setup only once, the first time you start Kolibri after the installation. You can change all the settings later, *except the type and the name of the facility*.

#. **Select the default language for Kolibri.**

	   Select the default Kolibri language.


	.. warning::
	  The default language configured for content in your browser preferences might override the language you choose in this step. To ensure that Kolibri displays in the desired language, make sure to configure it as default in the browsers of all the devices that will be used to view Kolibri content.


#. **Facility name and type.** A "Facility" is the location where you are installing Kolibri, such as a school, training center, or even your home. 

   **Non-formal** type can be used in libraries, orphanages, correctional facilities, youth centers, computer labs and similar, **Formal** one in schools and other formal learning contexts, and **Personal** should work best for parent-child or supplementary individual learning. 

   Formal and non-formal facilities require a name, while personal ones do not.

#. **User account creation.** 

  	.. figure:: img/sign-up.png
	   :alt: Step 4 of 7 where you can permit anyone to create a user account for themselves, or if user accounts must be created by Kolibri admins.

	   Select if anyone can create a user account for themselves, or if user accounts must be created by Kolibri admins.


#. **Enable passwords for learners.** Simplified sign-in, without the password requirement, allows easier access for younger learners.

  	.. figure:: img/enable-passwords.png
	   :alt: Step 5 of 7 where you can select if learners must type in their passwords to sign-in to Kolibri, or use just their username.

	   Select if learners must type in their passwords to sign-in to Kolibri.


#. **Create super admin account.** This admin user will be a **super admin**, able to manage all the device content, and all the rest of the facility users and their permissions.

  	.. figure:: img/super-admin.png
	   :alt: Step 6 of 7 is where you select the username and password for the facility super admin.

	   Select the username and password for the facility super admin.

	.. tip::
	  Make sure to save these super admin credentials in a safe place!


#. **Data usage and privacy - responsibilities of the administrator.** 
   When you are setting up a Kolibri facility, especially in formal contexts, you need to take into consideration the relevant privacy laws and regulations. You as the **super admin**, or someone you delegate, will be responsible for protecting and managing the user accounts and personal information stored on the device. Review the data usage and privacy statement before finishing the facility setup. 

  	.. figure:: img/super-admin-resp.png
	   :alt: Step 7 of 7 requires you to review the super admin responsibilities regarding the data usage and privacy.

	   Review the super admin responsibilities regarding the data usage and privacy.


Once you finish the initial setup, proceed to :ref:`import some content <manage_content_ref>`, and :ref:`create users <manage_users_ref>` (if you chose the Admin-managed facility setup). Make sure to check how to :ref:`configure other computers <access_LAN>` in the network to access Kolibri.
