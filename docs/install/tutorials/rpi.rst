An offline Raspberry Pi server
==============================

This guide shows you how to configure a Raspberry Pi as a local Wi-Fi hotspot serving Kolibri.

There are several varieties of operating systems for Raspberry Pi. This guide is intended for and tested on `Raspbian <https://raspbian.org/>`__, the most popular choice of OS, based on Debian.

.. warning:: These steps require an internet connection during the installation. After completing the installation, it's possible :ref:`to replicate an image <rpi_replication>` for offline installation.

Prerequisites
-------------

    Raspberry Pi 3


* Raspberry Pi Model 3+
* Formatted MicroSD Card > 4GB (64 GB recommended or attached USB storage)
* Card reader for a laptop or computer to write to the MicroSD card
* Latest Raspbian Stretch OS .img file

  * `Raspbian Desktop <http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/>`__
  * `Raspbian Lite <http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/>`__
  * **Or** `Installation of Raspbian via NOOBS <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md>`__
* Internet connectivity (for setting up the device)
* An internal MicroSD card is used for the base system, and an external storage media for contents (for instance a 64 GB USB flash). We recommend that you have an Ethernet cable for online connectivity while installing and fetching contents for Kolibri.

.. tip:: The standard Raspbian OS has a graphical desktop. You can also install Raspbian Lite which uses fewer resources, but only has a command line interface. The instructions in this documentation work seamlessly on both.


Getting started guides
----------------------

This guide provides a step-by-step setup of Kolibri but does not try to explain basic concepts for your Raspberry Pi. If you are new to the system, you are encouraged to read the official `Getting Started <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started>`__ guide for basic knowledge about setting up your device.

In doubt about which Raspbian to choose? We recommend using Raspbian Lite if you are comfortable with an environment that only has a terminal and no graphical user interface. Using the desktop version will consume more CPU, memory and electricity. Finally, you do have the option to :ref:`switch off the desktop environment <rpi_tip_desktop_disable>` once you have finished setting up the device.

We install Kolibri as one of the very final step. But please read and complete the prior steps.

Setting up the SD card
----------------------

The following commands work on Linux/macOS for setting up the .img files provided. You will also need to know the *device node* for the SD Card reader. On Linux, this is typically ``/dev/mmcblk0`` for the 0th card in your card reader.

.. code-block:: console

  # Unpack the .zip into memory and write it to <device node>
  unzip -p /path/to/raspbian-stretch-lite.zip | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk123 bs=4M conv=fsync

.. tip:: Read the official guides for setting up your card: `Copying .img files <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>`__

.. tip:: Select your MicroSD card based on other people's experiences and technical benchmarks. For more information, read `this Community Forums thread <https://community.learningequality.org/t/microsd-cards-picking-the-right-one-experiences-and-benchmarks/935>`__.

Updating the software
---------------------

After installing and starting up your Raspberry Pi, it is recommended that you upgrade all the software on the device:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo reboot  # Ensure that updates are active

Updating the firmware
---------------------

Run ``sudo rpi-update`` to update the firmware. Nothing in this tutorial necessitates this, but it's always recommended because hardware issues may be solved over time and performance improved. You cannot replicate this by copying MicroSD cards, you would have to repeat this step for every new Raspberry Pi device that you are installing.

General system configuration
----------------------------

Run ``sudo raspi-config`` for the general setup options such as keyboard layout, timezone etc.

.. warning:: Always change your password after setting up device. The default password for the user ``pi`` is ``raspberry``.

Setting up a hotspot
--------------------

The Raspberry Pi 3 has an internal Wi-Fi adapter which can serve as an access point, thus giving other devices the ability to connect to the Raspberry Pi through Wi-Fi. In this case, we call the Raspberry Pi a *hotspot*.

We assume that you will need to connect the Raspberry Pi to the internet both before and after setting up the hotspot. The easiest way to achieve this is through the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet cable connection. In this way, you don't have to disable and enable the Wi-Fi configuration each time.

* The device can be set up such that it automatically uses the Ethernet interface as a *gateway* to the internet when a cable is connected.
* If you need to connect to the internet through Wi-Fi, you will have to disable the hotspot and connect through the normal network management.

.. note: If you already have a Wi-Fi network at the location where the device will be set up, you should NOT set up an additional hotspot. You can connect the Raspberry Pi to an existing network and access it from there. Skip this step and the Captive Portal step.

Installing hostapd and dnsmasq
******************************

In order to serve clients on a local Wi-Fi hotspot, you need the Raspberry Pi to act as:

* an access point
* a DHCP server
* a DNS server

The access point is handled by the package ``hostapd`` and the DHCP and DNS server are both available through the ``dnsmasq`` package. We will install and configure both in this section. For more detailed information, see `the online Raspberry Pi docs <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md>`__.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt install dnsmasq hostapd

Setting a static IP
*******************

Firstly, the server's Wi-Fi interface ``wlan0`` needs to have a predictable IP address and not try to obtain it from another server. We call this a *static IP*.

It is defined in the configuration file ``/etc/dhcpcd.conf``, which you can edit through the below command.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Use the arrow keys to navigate to the end of the file, then copy and paste the following text and press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to save and exit.

.. code-block:: text

  interface wlan0
      static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
      nohook resolv.conf, wpa_supplicant

Then, make your current local DNS available

After installing the new ``hostapd`` and ``dnsmasq`` packages and setting a static IP, you should reboot the system.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo reboot

After rebooting, you can ensure that your system is running with the static IP address by running the command ``ipconfig`` and reviewing that ``wlan0`` has the new IP address printed. It should contain this output (notice the IP address):

.. code-block:: text

  wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
          inet 192.168.4.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.4.255
          inet6 fe80::e02e:4991:29ac:f076  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>

Configure DHCP and DNS
**********************

We create a new configuration file for ``dnsmasq`` in the appropriate location and start editing it:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/hotspot.conf

Copy and paste the following text, then press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to save and exit.

.. code-block:: text

  # Gateway + DNS server
  dhcp-option=3,192.168.4.1
  dhcp-option=6,192.168.4.1

  # Let the Raspberry Pi resolve to all DNS queries
  address=/#/192.168.4.1

.. warning::

  These settings override the possibility to connect to an online source using the Wi-Fi. It is still possible to connect to the internet **through the cabled network**, however you will need to configure a DNS server manually every time you reboot the device. Put the IP of your DNS provider in ``/etc/resolve.conf``. If you don't know it, you can use Google's OpenDNS address ``8.8.8.8`` as in this example:

  .. code-block:: console

    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf


Configure the access point
**************************

You will need to write a configuration file with information about your local Wi-Fi network.

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd

In the file, copy in the following configuration to specify the name of the network, its Wi-Fi channel (frequency) and bandwidth mode (we recommend 2.4 GHz 'g' mode). Set ``hw_mode=a`` to use 5 GHz. Press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to save and exit.

.. code-block:: text

  interface=wlan0
  driver=nl80211
  ssid=Offline Library
  hw_mode=g
  channel=7
  wmm_enabled=0
  macaddr_acl=0
  auth_algs=1
  ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

  # Remove the '#' in front of below lines to set a password 'Password'
  # wpa=2
  # wpa_passphrase=Password
  # wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  # wpa_pairwise=TKIP
  # rsn_pairwise=CCMP

Next, edit ``/etc/default/hostapd`` to enable the configuration file that we have just written:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd

At the bottom of the file, add the following text and press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to exit and save.

.. code-block:: text

  DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

Finally, start the access point system service ``hostapd`` and the DHCP and DNS server ``dnsmasq``:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo systemctl start hostapd
  sudo systemctl start dnsmasq


Setting up a "Captive portal"
-----------------------------

You don't have to set up a "Captive Portal", but it's a good idea, since the behavior will make the user experience better. Users won't have to guess the location (hostname / domain) of services on the Raspberry Pi, and many devices support displaying your welcome page automatically upon connecting to the Wi-Fi.

.. figure:: /img/captive_portal_screenshot.png
    :alt: Hotspot login dialog

    This type of dialog will appear on many devices when they detect a successful Wi-Fi connection without an internet connection.

In the previous step, we have configured the Raspberry Pi to tell devices on the local offline hotspot that whatever resource they request such as ``http://domain.com``, it should resolve to the Raspberry Pi's static IP address ``192.168.4.1``.

Firstly, install the HTTP server nginx:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo apt install nginx

Then, you need to edit and adapt your default Captive Portal page. You can use :download:`this template </data/captive_portal_index.html>`.

Copy the contents of the template by editing ``/var/www/html/index.html``:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

You can use :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`SHIFT` + :guilabel:`V` to paste text in the terminal. Press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to exit and save.


Installing Kolibri
------------------

#. First we need to upgrade the ``python3-cffi`` library, which is outdated on Raspbian. Upgrade it like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install libffi-dev python3-pip python3-pkg-resources dirmngr
      sudo pip3 install pip setuptools --upgrade
      sudo pip3 install cffi --upgrade

#. Add our Ubuntu PPA with these special instructions:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo su -c 'echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/learningequality/kolibri/ubuntu xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/learningequality-ubuntu-kolibri-xenial.list'
      sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys DC5BAA93F9E4AE4F0411F97C74F88ADB3194DD81
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install kolibri

   When asked questions during the installation, it is recommended that you use the default ``pi`` user for running Kolibri because it will have access to USB devices.

#. When the command finishes, open the default browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and proceed with the :ref:`setup_initial` of your facility.


.. note:: The following issues are quite common on a Raspberry Pi:

  * **System time** isn't set properly or resets during power-off. This causes errors while downloading software. For instance, SSL certificates for online sources will fail to validate. Ensure that you have the right timezone in ``/etc/timezone`` and that the clock is set properly by running ``sudo ntpd -gq``.

  * **Storage space** is often scarce. If you have a USB source for additional storage, you can use the ``kolibri manage movedirectory`` command or create your own symbolic links to have the data folder located elsewhere.

    Using the built-in management command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Stop kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri stop
        # Move the data
        kolibri manage movedirectory /path/to/your/external_drive
        # Start kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri start

  * **I/O operations are slow**: This means that a typical bottleneck on a Raspberry Pi is file transfer to/from MicroSD card or USB attached storage. Once Kolibri is up and running, this will not be a bottleneck, but while copying initial contents of several gigabytes, you will experience this. Both the SD card reader and the USB ports will limit you at 50-80MB/sec. From our experience, it doesn't matter much whether you are using the main SD card reader for storage or some media connected to your USB, as in principle they both reach about the same maximum speeds. However, you may find significant differences in the speeds of individual SD Cards.

    When replicating installations, you can save time if you connect the SD card of USB storage to another device with faster transfer speeds. Replication will be described in future guides.

Set up Kolibri local domain
***************************

After completing the installation, you can make kolibri available on port ``:80`` in addition to ``:8080``. This will make it possible to type, for example, a domain ``kolibri.lan`` in the browser location bar, and because of our captive portal, it will display.

.. tip:: You can use another domain name instead of ``kolibri.lan``.

To enable your Nginx web server to serve Kolibri, edit ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/kolibri`` and add a so-called *virtual host*:

.. code-block:: console

  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/kolibri

Copy and paste the following into the configuration file:

.. code-block:: text

  server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name kolibri kolibri.lan;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
  }

Press :guilabel:`CTRL` + :guilabel:`X` to exit and save. Then enable the new configuration by linking it into the directory of enabled virtual hosts:

.. code-block:: console

  ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kolibri /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

Uninstall
*********
From the command line: ``sudo apt-get remove kolibri``.


Upgrade
*******

When you use the PPA installation method, upgrades to newer versions will be automatic, provided there is internet access available.

Attaching USB storage
---------------------

Many people have a 4 GB or 16 GB MicroSD card that came along with the Raspberry Pi. In order to have more content, such as the full Khan Academy, you may want to attach a USB storage media -- a flash device or a hard drive.

.. tip:: Moving content: If you have a USB source for additional storage, you can use the ``kolibri manage movedirectory`` command or create your own symbolic links to have the data folder located elsewhere.

    Using the built-in management command:

    .. code-block:: console

        # Stop kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri stop
        # Move the data
        kolibri manage movedirectory /path/to/your/external_drive
        # Start kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri start


    **Or** using symbolic links, you need to start and stop Kolibri and to set the permissions correctly:

    .. code-block:: console

        # Stop kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri stop
        # Relocate the full Kolibri data and configuration user folder
        sudo mv /home/pi/.kolibri /your/external/media/kolibri_data
        # Ensure that the kolibri system service user owns the folder
        sudo chown -R pi /your/external/media/kolibri_data
        # Restore the original location with a symbolic link
        sudo ln -s /your/external/media/kolibri_data /home/pi/.kolibri
        # Start kolibri
        sudo systemctl kolibri start


Other tips
----------

Locale warnings
***************

You may encounter warnings like ``Can't set locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct!`` while installing software about the system locale. Typically, these are missing UTF-8 locales for your chosen system locale. These can be fixed by running this from command line:

.. code-block:: console

  # Run this and select the appropriate missing UTF-8 locales
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

.. _rpi_tip_desktop_disable:

Disabling the graphical desktop
*******************************

Once the Pi device is deployed, the desktop environment may no longer serve a purpose. It can safely be disabled. This saves computer resources and electricity. Use the following steps to disable or enable the desktop:

.. code-block:: console

  # Run the configuration and navigate to the Boot option, selecting "Console"
  sudo raspi-config


.. _rpi_replication:

Saving your image for replication
---------------------------------

Once you like the setup and you may want to deploy several Raspberry Pis to different schools, classrooms etc.

.. tip:: Using the same Wi-Fi SSID (in this tutorial, we called it ``Offline Library``) is recommended if you are setting up several Raspberry Pis in the same area. But you should configure them on different Wi-Fi channels. Separate them by a count of 2, this will avoid radio frequency overlaps.

.. warning:: Replicating the Kolibri device registration will make online synchronization unpredictable (fail).

Kolibri has a sync'ing mechanism whereby user data can synchronize from device to device through an online service. This happens automatically when Kolibri detects an internet connection. You need to unregister (deprovision) your device before copying the SD card and external storage:

.. code-block:: console

  kolibri manage deprovision

After replicating your SD card and external storage device, you need re-register the Kolibri installation on each device. This can be done without removing the installed data:

.. code-block:: console

  # This will ask you questions
  kolibri manage provisiondevice


Future steps
------------

Kolibri is under development with regards to optimizing performance on Raspberry Pi. We are adding support for multiple CPU cores, and since the Raspberry Pi has 4 of these, it will benefit greatly. Tests indicate almost a factor 4.

This work will be released in a future package targeting a pre-configured UWSGI and Nginx implementation, which will be possible to add by replacing the package of this tutorial with the new package. We will add a release note and update this tutorial accordingly.

You may also want to install other services such as `Kiwix <https://www.kiwix.org>`_. If you have followed this tutorial, you can install Kiwix alongside Kolibri by downloading the ``kiwix-serve`` package and adding an Nginx configuration similar to the one we added for Kolibri.

The Wi-Fi antenna and chip in the Raspberry Pi do not have capacity for many clients. Thus, you may also want to connect a stronger Access Point. If you intend to do this, you should modify the DHCP server (dnsmasq) to listen to the ``eth0`` device instead of ``wlan0``, switching off the Wi-Fi by removing ``hostapd``.

There are several bottle necks in this setup, but we recommend that you focus on the strong sides of the Raspberry Pi platform: It's low-cost and uses little electricity. Perhaps you can connect it to solar power? Perhaps you can implement a good system for distributing software updates and replacement parts?

.. tip:: Using a Raspberry Pi is subject to many tips and tricks not described here - please share your performance experiences in the `Community Forums <https://community.learningequality.org/t/microsd-cards-picking-the-right-one-experiences-and-benchmarks/935>`__.
