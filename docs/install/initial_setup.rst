Initial Setup
=============

Setting up Kolibri will be different depending on your learning environment:

* If you plan to use Kolibri at home or for supplemental learning outside any facility, use **Quick start**
* If you are installing Kolibri to be used by many learners at a formal facilities like schools, or non-formal like libraries or community centers, use **Advanced setup**.

.. note::
  You will only need to do the initial setup once, when you first start Kolibri after the installation. You can change all the settings later.

Quick Start
-----------

To do the initial setup of Kolibri for use at home, follow these steps.


#. **Select the default language** for Kolibri.

  	.. figure:: /img/select-language.png

	   Select the default Kolibri language.


	.. warning::
	  The default language configured for content in your browser preferences might override the language you choose in this step. To ensure that Kolibri displays in the desired language, make sure to configure it as default in the browsers of all the devices that will be used to view Kolibri content.


#. **Select the Quick start** setup option.
   
  	.. figure:: /img/quick-start.png
	   :alt:  

	   Select Quick start for personal or home use of Kolibri.


#. **Create super admin account.** This user will be a **super admin**, able to manage all the content and all other Kolibri users on this device.

  	.. figure:: /img/super-admin.png
	   :alt:  

	   Select the username and password for the super admin.

	.. tip::
	  Make sure to save these super admin credentials in a safe place!


Once you finish the initial setup, proceed to :ref:`import some learning resources <manage_resources_ref>`, and :ref:`create users <manage_users_ref>` if more people at your home are going to be using Kolibri. Make sure to check how to :ref:`configure other devices <access_LAN>` (computers, tablets or smartphones) in the home network to access Kolibri.


Advanced Setup
--------------


#. **Select the default language for Kolibri.**

  	.. figure:: /img/select-language.png
	   :alt:  

	   Select the default Kolibri language.


	.. warning::
	  The default language configured for content in your browser preferences might override the language you choose in this step. To ensure that Kolibri displays in the desired language, make sure to configure it as default in the browsers of all the devices that will be used to view Kolibri content.


#. **Select the Advanced setup** option, recommended for schools, educational programs, organizations, or other group learning settings that will share Kolibri. 
   
	  .. figure:: /img/advanced-setup.png
		   :alt:  

		   Select Advanced setup for use of Kolibri in group learning environments.			
   

#. **Select the name of the device** on which Kolibri server will be running from. Choose a meaningful and recognizable name because it will help you identify it during syncing and importing processes later on. 

	  .. figure:: /img/device-name.png
		   :alt:  

		   Select a meaningful name for the device.	

#. **Create or import a facility**. In Kolibri we use the term "facility" to describe a set of user accounts, classes, and their associated data. Examples of facilities include schools, temporary learning hubs,  groups of distributed at-home learners, and other situations requiring continuity between learners' activities. At this step you can choose to create a new facility or import one from another device.
   
Create a New Facility
*********************

#. **Type of facility**. When you create a new facility you can choose between **Non-formal** (libraries, orphanages, correctional facilities, youth centers, computer labs and similar), or a **Formal** type of facility (schools and other formal learning contexts).

	  .. figure:: /img/facility-type-name.png
		   :alt: Step 1 of 6. 

		   Select what type of learning environment is your facility and give it a name.

#. **Guest access**. 

  	.. figure:: /img/guest-access.png
	   :alt: Step 2 of 6. 

	   Select if guests can access Kolibri content without the need to create an account.


#. **User account creation**.

  	.. figure:: /img/sign-up.png
	   :alt: Step 3 of 6. 

	   Select if anyone can create a user account for themselves, or if user accounts must be created by Kolibri admins.


#. **Enable passwords for learners**. Simplified sign-in, without the password requirement, allows easier access for younger learners.

  	.. figure:: /img/enable-passwords.png
	   :alt: Step 4 of 6.

	   Select if learners must type in their passwords to sign-in to Kolibri.


#. **Create super admin account**. This admin user will be a **super admin**, able to manage all the device content, and all the rest of the facility users and their permissions.

  	.. figure:: /img/super-admin.png
	   :alt: Step 5 of 6.

	   Select the username and password for the facility super admin.

	.. tip::
	  Make sure to save these super admin credentials in a safe place!


#. **Responsibilities of the administrator**. When you are setting up a Kolibri facility you need to take into consideration the relevant privacy laws and regulations. You as the **super admin**, or someone you delegate, will be responsible for protecting and managing the user accounts and personal information stored on the device. Review the data usage and privacy statement before finishing the facility setup. 

  	.. figure:: /img/super-admin-resp.png
	   :alt: Step 6 of 6.

	   Review the super admin responsibilities regarding the data usage and privacy.


Once you finish the initial setup, proceed to :ref:`import some learning resources <manage_resources_ref>`, and :ref:`create users <manage_users_ref>` (if you chose the Admin-managed facility setup). Make sure to check how to :ref:`configure other computers <access_LAN>` in the network to access Kolibri.

.. _import_facility:


Import Facility
***************

If you are part of a wider learning environment, or you need to sync the learner progress data from your facility with another device where Kolibri is running, you can choose to import a facility that is already set up on that device.

#. Click :guilabel:`Import facility` button in the **Create or import facility** setup step. 

#. Any device that has Kolibri running in the local network should appear in the **Select network address** window.

	Select the device and click the :guilabel:`Continue` button.

  	.. figure:: /img/initial-setup-select-device.png
	   :alt:

				:alt: Add the network address of the device manually.

				Add the network address of the device manually.

		.. warning:: **Firewals** may impede your ability to see other devices in your local network, or add them as source. If you are unable to see other devices, make sure to:

			* disable the firewalls on all the devices that you need to sync
			* restart Kolibri for broadcast to take effect

#. **Select facility**. If there several facilities on the device, select the one you want to import, and provide the administrative credentials. 

  	.. figure:: /img/initial-setup-select-facility-to-import.png
