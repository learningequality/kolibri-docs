.. _lin:

Debian/Ubuntu Linux
===================


Install from PPA repository
---------------------------

Use the following commands in Terminal to add the PPA and install Kolibri:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:learningequality/kolibri
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install kolibri


.. _lin_deb:

Install from a .deb file
------------------------

The advantages of downloading a ``.deb`` file is the portability: you can copy the file from device to device and install Kolibri without internet access.

#. Download the latest Kolibri `DEB installer <https://learningequality.org/r/kolibri-deb-latest>`_, or have it copied to your local drive.
#. Run this command from the location where you downloaded the ``DEB`` file:

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo dpkg -i kolibri-installer-filename.deb

#. Wait for the installation to finish and run this command to start Kolibri:

   .. code-block:: bash

       kolibri start
	
#. When command finishes, open the default browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and proceed with the :ref:`setup_initial` of your facility. 


Uninstall
---------

* Open **Software** on Ubuntu and locate the Kolibri. Press **Remove**.
* Or from command line: ``sudo apt-get remove kolibri``.


Upgrade
-------

When you use the PPA installation method, upgrades to newer versions will be automatic, provided there is internet access available.

To upgrade Kolibri on a Debian device without internet access, bring the updated ``.deb`` file and follow the same steps as in :ref:`lin_deb`.


.. _raspberry_pi:

Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)
-----------------------

Kolibri currently doesn't work out of the box for Raspbian Jessie due. We are
refining our distribution to work out of the box, but you need to follow these
two steps (tested on Kolibri 0.9):

1. Running ``add-apt-repository`` as shown in the PPA instructions does not work. Instead, run::

      echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/learningequality/kolibri/ubuntu xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/learningequality-ubuntu-kolibri-xenial.list
      sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys DC5BAA93F9E4AE4F0411F97C74F88ADB3194DD81
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install kolibri

2. Kolibri does not start after installation. This is because ``python3-cffi`` is outdated on Raspbian. Upgrade it like this::

      sudo apt install libffi-dev
      sudo pip3 install pip --upgrade
      sudo pip3 install cffi --upgrade
      sudo systemctl start kolibri


.. warning: Loading channels can take a **long time** on a Raspberry Pi. When generating channel contens for Khan Academy, * Generating channel listing. This could take a few minutesâ€¦* means ~30 minutes. The device's computation power is the bottleneck. You might get logged out while waiting, but this is harmless and the process will continue. Sit tight!


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following issues are quite common on a Raspberry Pi:

* The time isn't set properly and you will have errors downloading software. For instance, SSL certificates for online sources will fail to validate. Ensure that you have the right timezone in ``/etc/timezone`` and that the clock is set properly by running ``sudo ntpd -gq``.

* You run out of storage space. If you have a USB source for additional storage, do something like this::

      sudo systemctl kolibri stop  # Stop kolibri
      sudo mv /var/kolibri/.kolibri /your/external/media/kolibri_data  # Move its data
      sudo chown -R kolibri /your/external/media/kolibri_data  # Ensure that the kolibri user owns the folder
      sudo ln -s /your/external/media/kolibri_data /var/kolibri/.kolibri  # Restore the original location with a symbolic link
      sudo systemctl kolibri start  # Start kolibri
