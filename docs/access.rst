##############


Starting Kolibri on Windows
===========================

To start the **Kolibri** server on Windows, just double-click the desktop shortcut. You will see the notification message *Kolibri is starting, please wait...*.

When you see the notification *Kolibri is running...*, **Kolibri** will open in the browser with the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080.

***********************

While it is running, **Kolibri** will display an icon in the Windows taskbar (usually at bottom right, near the clock), that allows you to stop it and configure other settings.

* Use the **Load in browser** option to open Kolibri in the browser.
* By default **Kolibri** will start running every time you start the computer where it is installed. Uncheck the **Run Kolibri at system startup** option if you prefer to start it manually from the desktop shortcut.
* When installed, **Kolibri** will open in the browser every time it is started. Uncheck the option **Open browser when Kolibri starts** if you prefer to have it running in the background, and to open it manually in the browser by typing the URL http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the address bar.
* Select **Exit** to stop **Kolibri**. You will be prompted to confirm the selection, after which **Kolibri** will stop. You will have to close the browser (or the tab) manually.

.. tip:: 
  If you close the browser window, Kolibri will still be running in the background. Use the **Load in browser** menu item to reopen it in the browser.

.. note::
  Remember to :ref:`configure other computers <access_LAN>` in the network to access **Kolibri** content.


Starting Kolibri on Linux or MacOS
==================================

Starting Kolibri on Linux and MacOS will differ depending on the method you used to install it.

* If you used the **PEX** package, Kolibri will be accessible as long as the process is running in the `Terminal <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal>`_. If you stop the process, close the Terminal window, or restart your system, you will need to :ref:`run the PEX again <pex>` to restart Kolibri. 

* If you installed Kolibri as a system service with the :ref:`DEB installer <lin_deb>`, it will run automatically on each system restart, and you do not need to start it manually. Proceed to step 2 below.

* If you installed Kolibri through the :ref:`PPA <ppa>`, or :ref:`generic installation <pip-installation>` with ``pip install`` command, follow these steps.

  1. Run this command in Terminal to start Kolibri:

    .. code-block:: bash

      kolibri start

    .. warning:: On macOS you may need to prefix the command with ``python``, and type ``python -m kolibri start`` instead.

  2. Open the default browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``, and it will display the **Kolibri** start page.

    .. note::
      Remember to :ref:`configure other computers <access_LAN>` in the network to access **Kolibri** content.

  3. Run this command in Terminal to stop Kolibri:

    .. code-block:: bash

      kolibri stop


.. _access_LAN:

Accessing Kolibri from Other Devices in the Network
===================================================

After you have installed and started Kolibri on the computer that will act as a server, you need to configure other devices in the the same `Local Area Network <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network>`_ (LAN), such as other computers, tablets or phones, so they can access the the learning content on the server.

Compatibility
*************

Kolibri currently supports the following combinations of operating systems and browsers for client devices:

* Windows 7, 8.1 and 10: IE 11+, Chrome and Firefox
* MacOS 10.6+: Safari, Chrome and Firefox
* Linux: any browser
* Android 4.4+: Chrome and Firefox
* iOS 10+: Safari, Chrome and Firefox

.. warning:: Videos are MP4 encoded. While most browsers do not require additional plugins or codecs, open source platforms will often require you to install MP4 codecs separately: For instance on Ubuntu, install the `restricted extras package <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats>`__.

Set up Access on Other Devices
******************************

To access content from other devices in the same network, you need to know the :ref:`IP address <ips>` of the computer where Kolibri is running. 

For example, if Kolibri is installed and started on a computer with the IP address **192.168.0.104**, you can access it from an Android tablet connected to the same network by opening the browser on the tablet and typing the address ``http://192.168.0.104:8080``.


.. tip::
  * You can check the IP (**Server URL**) of the device where Kolibri is running by going to **Info** tab in the **Device** dashboard.

    .. figure:: img/device-info.png
      :alt: Open the Device page and navigate to the Info tab to find the IP (Server URL) for your device.

      Find the IP/Server URL in the Device > Info tab.
  
  * You can also use the ``ipconfig`` command on Windows or ``ifconfig`` command on Linux/OSX to find the externally visible IP address of the device running the Kolibri.


.. note::
  * In case of network problems, see :ref:`troubleshooting tips <network>`.
