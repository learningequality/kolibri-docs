Storage
*******

When selecting resources to import to your Android device, keep in mind 2 things:
* Available storage space. Do frequent checks in Settings > Storage on your device to see how much internal space is available to import.
* Data consumption. If you need to restrict the usage of your mobile data plan, find an Internet access point or a WiFi network that you can use while importing channels.
