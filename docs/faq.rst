Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


How much does Kolibri cost to install?
--------------------------------------

Kolibri is **free and open source** software! To learn more about free software, see this `Free Software Foundation article <https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>`_.


Do I need the internet to run Kolibri?
--------------------------------------

Short answer: **No!** You can bring or send a storage device (USB or HDD unit) with Kolibri installer and content channels downloaded somewhere with available internet connection, and install everything on an completely offline device.

In a nutshell, Kolibri can run independently of internet availability, but you need to procure the installer and content channels from somewhere for the initial installation and for subsequent upgrades. 

One possibility is to have Kolibri installed in one location with internet connection, where you can import content channels from `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/>`_ (curriculum tool and content curation server), and then export them to removable USB drives that you bring or send to offline locations (rural schools, refugee camps, etc.) to import locally.

What are the typical deployment scenarios?
------------------------------------------

There is no typical implementation setting. However, we can share with you what we’ve learned from our community of KA Lite and Kolibri users. Some example implementation settings are provided below based on the presence of a coach and whether the settings allows for formal, non-formal, and informal learning.

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
|                           | Coach                             | No Coach                                                                       | 
+===========================+===================================+================================================================================+ 
| Formal and Non-Formal     | * School classroom                | * After school program                                                         |

|                           | * Supplementary education setting | * Use in classroom that has teacher, but without coach engagement or monitoring|
|                           |                                   |                                                                                |

What are some possible hardware configurations for deploying Kolibri?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy Kolibri for multiple users you will need:

#. **Server device**: a computer that is running the Kolibri software (e.g. a desktop computer, laptop, or Raspberry Pi).
#. One or more **client devices** that have web browsers (laptops, tablets, desktop computers, etc)

.. note::
  For a single-device deployment (1) and (2) can be the same computer, with the browser connecting to the locally running Kolibri server. To make the software accessible to multiple client devices, you will need to put them on the same local network as the Kolibri server device (1), e.g. through a WIFI access point.

To read more details, see the full `Kolibri Hardware Guide <https://learningequality.org/r/hardware-guide>`_ and examples of `Hardware Configurations for Kolibri <https://learningequality.org/r/hardware>`_ (PDF documents).


How can I generate content aligned to local curriculum?
-------------------------------------------------------

Use `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org/>`_ curriculum tool to curate content channels aligned to your local requirements. Once you finish creating the channels on Studio, you can import them on all your Kolibri deployments for use in learning environments.


Bulk Downloads of Content Channels
----------------------------------

``Coming soon!``

At this time we do not support bulk downloads of content channel outside the Kolibri platform.  In the near future, we will consider offering bit torrents for certain global content channels.
