Exercises
"""""""""

Kolibri **Exercises** can require you to do different things: fill in a missing number, write a formula, choose one of the available options, etc. Each correct answer gets you a check mark, and majority of exercises require 5 correct answers in a row to be completed. Some exercises can offer one or more hints, to help you solve the problem.

Independent of the required action (writing an answer yourself or choosing one of the options), these are the steps to follow.

#. **Read the question carefully**.
#. Write the answer or choose one of the provided options.
#. When you are ready to submit, click the :guilabel:`CHECK` button.

   * When the answer is correct and a |green-check| icon appears in the progress bar below the exercise, click the :guilabel:`NEXT` button to proceed.
   * If the answer is incorrect, read the question again, and try another answer. You can also click the :guilabel:`USE A HINT` link, read the suggestions, and try to answer again.
   * The progress bar below the exercise is taking into account only the most recent answers you give, which means that you need to have the required number of |green-check| icons **in the row** for the exercise to be considered completed.

    .. figure:: img/get-5-correct.png
	    :alt: If the exercise requires 5 green check marks, you must provide 5 correct answers one after another.

	    The correct answers in the image above are not in a row; this exercise will be completed only after you give 5 correct answers one after another.

#. Once you have achieved the required number of correct answers in a row, you will be rewarded points, and see the suggestion to continue. Click the card under the **Next resource** heading below to continue learning with the rest of the material in that topic.
