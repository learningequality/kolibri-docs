Manage Lessons
--------------

Kolibri **Lessons** offer you the possibility to prepare smaller selections of available learning resources and assign them to learners on a temporary basis. You can select resources from multiple channels, and copy the created lessons to other classes or groups as needed. 

To view, create or delete lessons, as well as assign them to learners, use the **Lessons** sub-tab in the |edit| **Plan** tab (|edit| icon) of your |coach| **Coach** dashboard. Default view displays the list of all lessons created for the selected class, the number of resources they contain, groups they are assigned to, and their status indicator.
